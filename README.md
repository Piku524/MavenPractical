## Difference between Clean Lifecycle and Default Lifecycle

### Clean Lifecycle

Its main purpose is to delete the target directory.

Phases:
- pre-clean
- clean
- post-clean

Command:
mvn clean

---

### Default Lifecycle
The Default lifecycle is used to build and package the project.

Phases:
- validate
- compile
- test
- package
- verify

### Difference
Clean lifecycle removes build artifacts, while Default lifecycle creates them.
Clean ensures a fresh build environment, Default performs compilation and packaging.
